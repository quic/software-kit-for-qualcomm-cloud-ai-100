/// \mainpage AIC Runtime Library
/// The AIC Runtime library is mainly composed of three layers. The top layer is
/// the API
/// layer which directly interacts with user applications. The main classes in
/// this layer are QRuntime for control path, and QNeuralNetwork for data path.
///
/// The bottom layer is the Driver layer which interfaces with
/// different driver backends. Four driver backends are planned at this time:
/// KMD (Kernel Mode Driver), UMD (User Mode Driver), Loopback and QSIM.
///
/// The middle layer is the Common layer which keeps the common functionality
/// for different driver implementations. For example, the parsing of
/// metadata and generation of request queue elements are both in this layer.
///
/// For the ease of description the API and Common layers are referred to
/// as the "frontend", while the Driver layer is referred to as the "backend".
///
/// The control path data exchange between frontend and backend is through
/// function calls. The data path data exchange between frontend and backend
/// is through request/response queues identical to DMA bridge hardware,
/// with the queues managed through QVirtualChannelInterface interface. The
/// queues
/// are provisioned by the drver backend at network activation.
///
/// The QRuntimePlatformKmdDeviceInterface class is the interface to be
/// implemented by the driver
/// backend. Most of the virtual functions in this class are for control
/// path. Data path related functions are in the implementation of
/// QVirtualChannelInterface class.
